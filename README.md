# MADNI Token

**What is MADNI Token?**  
MADNI Token is a digital loyalty token designed specifically for refill drink purchases at small shops, warungs, or cafes. Itâ€™s a simple, blockchain-based token (for example, built on the SIP-010 token standard) that replaces traditional manual recording methods with a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof system.

**Why MADNI Token?**  
Many refill drink vendors currently rely on manual systems â€” such as paper cards, stamps, or punch cards â€” to track customer purchases and reward loyal customers. However, these manual systems have several issues:

- **Easy to lose or damage:** Paper cards can get lost or worn out.  
- **Susceptible to fraud:** Stamps or punch cards can be faked or duplicated.  
- **Difficult to track:** Vendors struggle to maintain accurate, real-time records of customer loyalty.

MADNI Token solves these problems by creating a digital, verifiable record of each refill purchase.

**How Does MADNI Token Work?**

- **Minting Tokens:**  
  When a customer buys a refill drink, the shop owner (or cashier) mints MADNI Tokens to the customerâ€™s digital wallet. The number of tokens minted corresponds to the number of purchases.

- **Holding Tokens:**  
  Customers accumulate MADNI Tokens in their wallets, which serve as proof of their purchase history.

- **Redeeming Tokens:**  
  When the customer wants a free refill or discount, they redeem (burn) a certain amount of MADNI Tokens to claim the offer.

- **Transferring Tokens:**  
  Customers can also transfer tokens to friends or family â€” for example, to treat someone to a refill.
