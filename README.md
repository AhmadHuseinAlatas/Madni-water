What is MADNI Token?
MADNI Token is a digital loyalty token designed specifically for refill drink purchases at small shops, warungs, or cafes. It’s a simple, blockchain-based token (for example, built on the SIP-010 token standard) that replaces traditional manual recording methods with a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof system.

Why MADNI Token?
Many refill drink vendors currently rely on manual systems — such as paper cards, stamps, or punch cards — to track customer purchases and reward loyal customers. However, these manual systems have several issues:

Easy to lose or damage: Paper cards can get lost or worn out.

Susceptible to fraud: Stamps or punch cards can be faked or duplicated.

Difficult to track: Vendors struggle to maintain accurate, real-time records of customer loyalty.

MADNI Token solves these problems by creating a digital, verifiable record of each refill purchase.

How Does MADNI Token Work?
Minting Tokens:
When a customer buys a refill drink, the shop owner (or cashier) mints MADNI Tokens to the customer’s digital wallet. The number of tokens minted corresponds to the number of purchases.

Holding Tokens:
Customers accumulate MADNI Tokens in their wallets, which serve as proof of their purchase history.

Redeeming Tokens:
When the customer wants a free refill or discount, they redeem (burn) a certain amount of MADNI Tokens to claim the offer.

Transferring Tokens:
Customers can also transfer tokens to friends or family — for example, to treat someone to a refill.

Key Features of MADNI Token
mint(to, amount):
Only the shop owner’s wallet can mint tokens to customers, ensuring control and preventing unauthorized creation of tokens.

transfer(to, amount):
Customers can send tokens to other customers easily, enabling gifting or sharing refill credits.

redeem(amount):
Customers exchange tokens for free refills or discounts, and the corresponding tokens are burned (destroyed) from their balance to prevent reuse.

balanceOf(address):
Anyone can check the token balance of a wallet, making it easy to verify how many refills a customer has earned.

Benefits of Using MADNI Token
Transparency: All token transactions are recorded on the blockchain, making them secure and immutable.

Fraud prevention: Digital tokens can’t be easily forged or duplicated.

Customer engagement: Customers are incentivized to keep returning to the shop to earn and redeem tokens.

Flexibility: Tokens can be transferred, allowing social gifting and enhancing customer experience.

Convenience: Eliminates the need for physical cards or stamps, reducing costs and hassle for shop owners.

Example User Flow
Customer buys a refill drink.

Shop owner calls mint(customer_wallet, number_of_tokens) to credit the customer.

Customer accumulates tokens and can check balance anytime.

When ready for a free refill, customer calls redeem(number_of_tokens) to exchange tokens.

Tokens are burned upon redemption, and the customer enjoys a free or discounted refill.

Conclusion
MADNI Token is a practical, user-friendly, and secure digital loyalty solution tailored for small-scale beverage vendors. By leveraging blockchain technology, it modernizes the refill business, increases customer loyalty, and simplifies record-keeping — all while providing a transparent, trustworthy system for both vendors and customers.
